Duplicating stackable items is actually super simple in this version! It's also possible to dupe un-stackable items, but it's a bit more complicated. Watch the above video to find out how.

Ice Boating

Under normal circumstances, boating on ice barely increases your speed. However, if you start boating on ice and the go onto blocks with buttons or string on them, your speed increases dramatically.

Four Lines of Text

It's actually incredibly easy to access the fourth line of text on a sign in this version! Once you place a sign, press cancel, and then press up, and boom.

Ender Dragon Boat

In this version, you can use a boat to trap the ender dragon! This glitch is very helpful during speedruns.
